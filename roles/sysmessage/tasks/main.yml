      When logging in via ssh /etc/issue is not displayed
      by default. /etc/motd is displayed after login.
      To ensure proper compliance ensure sysmessage_motd
      and sysmessage_issue contain required text.
      If sysmessage_issue is empty, it will default to
      sysmessage_motd text.
